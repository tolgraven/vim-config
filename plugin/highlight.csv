# It is advisable to split your configuration into multiple groups (Group 1 = fatal/important messages; Group 2 = resource names;...)
# Since "hlnum" does not need to be continuous, grouping will make it easier for you to add or remove entries in the future.
# Eg.
# 1,red,,purple,,FATAL1
# 2,,green,,green,,FATAL2
# 100,blue,,blue,,NAME1
# 101,black,magenta,black,IndianRed,NAME2
# 200,,,,black,DarkOrange,INFO1
# 201,,,green,grey20,INFO2
#
# NOTE(1): There is basically no limit to the number that can be assigned to "hlnum", so number like "100023" is allowable.
# NOTE(2): For comments, start the line with hash (#).
