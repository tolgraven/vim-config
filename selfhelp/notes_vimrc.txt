for just one :w and moving cursor a tiny bit afterwards. So def an airline
	issue, but originating in git somehow...so, fugitive? or?
	SNR 162 = *~/.vim/plugged/vim-airline/autoload/airline/extensions/branch.vim*
	so slowness in |get_head()| is just from calls to |head()| which is just from
	its calls to |update_untracked()| which is in turn from |system()| which calls
	|jobstart()| / |system()| / |jobwait()| (nvim) or just |system()| (vim)

	gitgutter is also showing incorrect info when this happens, like "+27" lines
	for vimrc unchanging. So git is def pulling something weird.

	I guess gitgutter |remove_signs()| is also a bit suspicious and should be
	worked out (after whatever the primary airline ill is here)

Question 		can you prevent "exit insert"/"enter insert" or whatever, autocmds
						from running on a simple <C-o>? 
						Cause everything doing that gets really sluggish now. Example:
" inoremap <Up>      <C-o>gk
Note: outside of <C-o>, at least <C-c> skips InsertLeave. How skip InsertEnter?


<Plug> 			needs to be |map|-ed, no |nore|
|autocmds| 	dont protect matchadd() from duplicate matches. 
						Need to also wrap a check, if !exists()


fzf has |:Maps| which is p much like my <leader>map+lista filter.

   *ys* takes a valid Vim motion or text object as the first object, and wraps it using the second argument as with |cs|.  (It's a stretch, but a good mnemonic for "ys" is "you surround".)
 w*orld!             ysiw)       Hello (world)!

 special case, *yss* operates on the current line, ignoring leading whitespace.
w*orld!       yssB             {Hello world!}

   There is also *yS* and *ySS* which indent the surrounded text and place it on a line of its own.
