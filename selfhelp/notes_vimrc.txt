move to orgmode I guess...

* 'superbar' thing yeah
" :CD - change window-local CWD to dir of curr open buffer
	bit hand in hand: window-local fileexplorer

* show number of hits for current search + which one (if any) we're on, in statusline...
	only when search is fully active, ie. highlighted

* QUESTION: possible to define new colors? so dont have to choose between
	'guifg=blue', hi! link, and 'guifg=#5181e1'

* in vim syntax, each hi group should highlight any occurance of its own name. easy. nice.
* info: window-local (as opposed to buffer-local) syntax is set with
:ownsyntax foo

* debug syntax:
:syntime on
<do stuff>
:syntime report

" MAYBE:
" ligatures / iterm2 coretext vs core graphics rendering

Question: can you prevent "exit insert"/"enter insert" or whatever, autocmds
from running on a simple <C-o>? Cause everything doing that gets really
sluggish now. Example:
" inoremap <Up>      <C-o>gk


<Plug> needs to be map-ed, no *nore

fzf has :Maps which is p much like my <leader>map+lista filter.

   *ys* takes a valid Vim motion or text object as the first object, and wraps it using the second argument as with |cs|.  (It's a stretch, but a good mnemonic for "ys" is "you surround".)
 w*orld!             ysiw)       Hello (world)!

 special case, *yss* operates on the current line, ignoring leading whitespace.
w*orld!       yssB             {Hello world!}

   There is also *yS* and *ySS* which indent the surrounded text and place it on a line of its own.

[I list all lines containing word under cursor! remap to something?
or reimplement / find version that retains highlighting and actually highlights search


q: and q/  	= highlighted command window with list of prev cmds/searches
<C-f> opens history when already at : prompt

<C-X><C-L> = complete entire lines, p cool!

gn / gN = jump to next search match and select it visually. if already in visual, select to there...
gp / gP = paste without moving cursor
:read !shellcmd 		put output of cmd into buffer! sweet so like :read !pbpate
