"{{{1 				IDEAS
move to orgmode I guess...

* 'superbar' thing yeah
	bit hand in hand: window-local fileexplorer

* show number of hits for current search + which one (if any) we're on, in statusline...
	only when search is fully active, ie. highlighted

* QUESTION: possible to define new colors? so dont have to choose between
	'guifg=blue', hi! link, and 'guifg=#5181e1'

* in vim syntax, each hi group should highlight any occurance of itself. easy. nice.

"{{{2					 slow scrolling splits on left/right:
" first noticed because having nerdtree etc open would make shit mad laggy
" only happens sideways, a lone horiz split is still fast...
"
" gets exponentially worse with num of splits
"
" NOT RELATED:
" tmux / 24bit in tmux / etc - makes it worse I think but not root cause
" nvim - def same in vim
" termguicolors
" signcolumn
" cursorline / colorcolumn
" lazyredraw
" general vimrc changes since february - checked first commit...
" my vimrc / any plugs, at all, actually - same when using empty
" fira code / ligatures - at least when just switched off mid-session
"
" iterm2 --beta / --nightly vs. stable...
" iterm2 at all - seems same (but less hardcore maybe) in Terminal.app... != 
"
" MAYBE:
" ligatures / iterm2 coretext vs core graphics rendering 
"
" DEFINITELY:
" multiple scrolling regions, something?
" same phenomenom but actually 1000x worse scrolling with two shells open in a couple tmux splits...

   *ys* takes a valid Vim motion or text object as the first object, and wraps it using the second argument as with |cs|.  (It's a stretch, but a good mnemonic for "ys" is "you surround".)
 w*orld!             ysiw)       Hello (world)!

 special case, *yss* operates on the current line, ignoring leading whitespace.
w*orld!       yssB             {Hello world!}

   There is also *yS* and *ySS* which indent the surrounded text and place it on a line of its own.
